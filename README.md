# JAVA_Calculator
This is a basic calculator, with interfaces to the user, is easy to use it, we try to give you a good experience.
Firs of all we are in front of lot of problems:

---
### How we´ll do it?
If I am honest I don´t know, I have to find more resources, at the moment we have NEATBEANS but we need more practice for the calculator, the programm is not enough.

---
### Why ?
Above all for practice, I´ve noticed that I need a lot of practice with this, documentation, git, github, programming and more and what better way than start, it´s the only way to learn and improve, at least that´s what I think, also I´ll try to do and interesting tool for the students, I want that this proyect have more tools than normal calculators.

---
### How long is going it to take?
For my experience I think it will take about maybe 3 to 5 weeks, why?, because I don´t have enough knowledge, then I must try to do my best in some time.

---
### Potential problems
One problem is that I don´t know very well how programm in JAVA because I have not practice enough, I have more idea with C++ but this proyect will be in JAVA, then I must learn and improve more in the established time, I have a idea do the logic things with c++ and then move it to JAVA. but the main code will be in JAVA, I want clarify this.
